## What?

Simple wardle solver.

## Why?

Because games like wordie are DDoS attacks on human attention. The "logic" required to solve any wordel is trivial. No creativity or thought required, just basic remembering a bunch of words in some arbitrary language. Why are humans still manually doing this sort of thing and bragging about it online as if it was some significant achievement? A pocket calculator can do this shit.

## Prerequisites
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Usage:

`python solver.py`

Then type the suggestion into wordle and type "g", "y" or "-" into the solver based on whether wordle returns green, yellow or otherwise. gg worlde
